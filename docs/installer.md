# Installer

If you're looking for a super quick way to start up a Quarx based site, we've built a simple app making command. Otherwise, try out adding to an existing app.

To get the installer just run the following:

```php
composer global request yab/quarx-installer
```

Then to start a new app which uses the Quarx setup command run:

```php
quarx new {APP_NAME}
```
